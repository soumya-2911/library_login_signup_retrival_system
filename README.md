# library_login_signup_retrival_system
It's a login and signup system for a library to manage the position of its books in shelves.

## server.js
Node- Express server that handles post and get requests from the client's frontend.
Although I have ran the client frontend on the server itself. But these can be separated by making a client.js file and display the pages on it using express.

## page
It contains the frontend html/css/javascript files to be shown on client's computer
##
User can login/signup to their accounts . Ater success they will be redirected to their dashboard where user can find the position of the desired book in the library.
It uses mongodb as a database.
